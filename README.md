<!--
**camsgoms/camsgoms** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 👩‍💻 Currently, I'm a student in the Analysis and Systems Development course at IFPE
- ✨ interning at TRF5
- ☕ I'm looking to learn more about the back-end area, specifically about Java system development
